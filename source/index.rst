Continuous Sphinx
=================

An example of continuous integration and deployment of a sphinx project using
`Travis-CI`_ and `Netlify`_

Continuous Integration using Travis-CI
======================================

The sphinx builder allows you to specify a builder that produces no output, but
the input is parsed and checked for consistency, which makes it perfect for
linting with `Travis-CI`_.

Continuous Deployment using Netlify
===================================

This will be the second step.
